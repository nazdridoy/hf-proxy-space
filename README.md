## ðŸš€ HFâ€‘Inferoxy AI Hub

A focused, multiâ€‘modal AI workspace. Chat, create images, transform images, generate short videos, and synthesize speech â€” all routed through HFâ€‘Inferoxy for secure, quotaâ€‘aware token management and provider failover.

### Highlights
- Chat, Image, Imageâ€‘toâ€‘Image, Video, and TTS in one app
- Works with any HF model exposed by your proxy
- Multiâ€‘provider routing; default provider is `auto`
- Streaming chat and curated examples

### Quick Start (Hugging Face Space)
Add Space secrets:
- `PROXY_URL`: HFâ€‘Inferoxy server URL (e.g., `https://proxy.example.com`)
- `PROXY_KEY`: API key for your proxy
- `ALLOWED_ORGS`: Comma/spaceâ€‘separated org slugs allowed to use the Space

The app reads these at runtime â€” no extra setup required.

### How It Works
1. The app requests a valid token from HFâ€‘Inferoxy for each call.
2. Requests are sent to the selected provider (or `auto`).
3. Status is reported back for rotation and telemetry.

### Using the App
- Chat: message â†’ choose model/provider (`auto` by default) â†’ tune temperature/topâ€‘p/max tokens.
- Image: prompt â†’ optional width/height (Ã·8), steps, guidance, seed, negative prompt.
- Imageâ€‘toâ€‘Image: upload base image â†’ describe the change â†’ generate.
- Video: brief motion prompt â†’ optional steps/guidance/seed.
- TTS: text â†’ pick TTS model â†’ adjust voice/style if supported.

### Configuration
- Model id only (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`).
- Provider from dropdown. Default is `auto`.

### Providers
Compatible with providers configured in HFâ€‘Inferoxy, including `auto` (default), `hf-inference`, `cerebras`, `cohere`, `groq`, `together`, `fal-ai`, `replicate`, `nebius`, `nscale`, and others.

### Security
- HF OAuth validates account/org membership (no inference scope).
- Inference uses proxyâ€‘managed tokens. Secrets are Space secrets.
- RBAC, rotation, and quarantine handled by HFâ€‘Inferoxy.

### Troubleshooting
- 401/403: verify secrets and org access.
- 402/quota: handled by proxy; retry later or switch provider.
- Image size: width/height must be divisible by 8.
- Slow/failures: try smaller models, fewer steps, or another provider.
